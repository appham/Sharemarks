# Sharemarks
A simple and minimalist bookmark manager app for Android. Bookmarks can be added via the Android share intents. Developed with Kotlin.


The idea is that the Sharemark app can save anything as a bookmark that gets shared to it via Android share intents.

Usage: 
1. In an external app that has an Android share feature (like for example Chrome Browser, Google Play Store etc.) click the share icon.
2. In the chooser select "Sharemarks" to share the bookmark with this app.
3. The shared bookmark appears in the list. On click on the shared bookmark the link will be opened.
4. Swipe left to delete the bookmark. Swipe right or long click to share it.
